This is a simple journaling app that helps you jot down your thoughts. I had the idea to create this during summer of 2021. Multiple entries can be created. The idea was to have each entry be a different tone of green-yellow-orange depending on the day it was written. In any given season, the colors most strongly resemble:

    - Spring: Green
    - Summer: Yellow
    - Fall: Orange
    - Winter: Celeste
