This is a simple journaling app that helps you jot down your thoughts. Multiple entries can be entered, and the application should be able to recognize the day and time (and tentatively the temperature) when the entry was written.

The explore section will prompt the user with simple short questions that will help them reflect about themselves, or just for entertainment. It will also show user statistics, such as streak, number of entries, a reminder of what was done a year ago, etc.
